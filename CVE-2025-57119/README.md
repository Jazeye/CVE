# *CVE-2025-57119: No Rate Limiting Vulnerability in the Admin Panel of PHPGurukul Online-Library-Management-System v3.0*

## *Description*

A "No Rate Limiting" vulnerability in Online Library Management System v3.0 allows an attacker to repeatedly attempt logins on the adminlogin.php page without restriction. This can enable brute-force attacks to discover valid credentials, escalate privileges, and gain unauthorized access to the admin dashboard, potentially compromising the entire system.

## *Steps to Reproduce (PoC)*

1. Navigate to the admin login page: GET /adminlogin.php.
2. Capture a valid login POST request using a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite).
3. Send the captured request to a brute-force tool (e.g., Intruder).
4. Configure the attack to iterate over common admin usernames and weak passwords.
5. Start the attack and observe that the server continues to accept login attempts with no rate limiting or account lockout.
6. Successful attempts may reveal valid credentials, allowing unauthorized access to the admin dashboard.

## *Impact*

The absence of rate limiting on the admin login page allows attackers to perform unlimited brute-force attempts, which can result in credential compromise, unauthorized access, and full control of the system.

## *Mitigation*

Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms, enforce strong password policies, and enable multi-factor authentication to prevent brute-force attacks.
