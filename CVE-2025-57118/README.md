# *CVE-2025-57118: No Rate Limiting vulnerability in Online-Library-Management-System v3.0*

## *Description*

A "No Rate Limiting" vulnerability was identified in Online-Library-Management-System v3.0. The login page lacks rate limiting and account-lockout controls, allowing unlimited brute-force attempts using weak passwords or common usernames.

## *Steps to Reproduce (PoC)*

1. Navigate to the login page of PHPGurukul Online-Library-Management-System v3.0.
2. Capture a valid login request (e.g., with Burp Suite or similar proxy).
3. Send the request to Intruder (or another brute-force tool).
4. Configure the attack to iterate over a list of common usernames and weak passwords.
5. Start the attack â€” observe that there is no rate limiting or account lockout, and the server continues to respond to unlimited login attempts.
6. Successful attempts reveal valid user credentials, leading to unauthorized access.

## *Impact*

The lack of rate limiting on the login page allows attackers to perform unlimited brute-force attempts, which can lead to account compromise and unauthorized access.

## *Mitigation*

Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms, enforce strong password policies, and enable multi-factor authentication to reduce the risk of brute-force attacks.
