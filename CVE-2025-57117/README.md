# *CVE-2025-57117: Clickjacking vulnerability in Sourcecodester Employee Management System V1.0*

## *Description*

 A Clickjacking vulnerability exists in Rems' Employee Management System 1.0. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the department.php page injecting a malicious payload into the "Department Name" field under "Add Department.

## *Steps to Reproduce (PoC)*

1. Navigate to /employee-management-system/department.php and open Add Department.
2. Inject a malicious payload into the Department Name field (e.g., a stored XSS payload).
3. Submit the form. A View More button/area is displayed that contains the stored value.
4. If a victim clicks the crafted View More button/area on the vulnerable page, the injected JavaScript executes and can steal the session ID.

## *Impact*

Clickjacking allows attackers to trick users into unintended actions, which can lead to execution of malicious JavaScript, account compromise, or data theft.

## *Mitigation*

Implement X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (frame-ancestors) headers to prevent the site from being embedded in malicious frames.
